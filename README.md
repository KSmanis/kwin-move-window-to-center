# Move Window to Center
A simple KWin script that introduces a KDE Global Shortcut for centering the active window in the current screen.

## Usage
The script is automatically enabled after [installation](INSTALL.md), but you might have to restart KWin in order to use it for the first time. The KDE Global Shortcut that is assigned by default is `Meta+C`, but you can change it under `System Settings > Shortcuts > Global Shortcuts > KWin`.
